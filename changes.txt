v1.2.3-eva2000.07 30/06/2014
- Improvements to speed up install process - up to 40-60% faster install time than previous versions.
- Added back the return of an optional cli install method which bypasses the menu option #1 install method. If you run ./centmin.sh install, you can bypass the shell based menu for fully unattended installation.
- Added SELINUX check
- Added new menu option #21 update – it upgrades Nginx, PHP-FPM and Siege benchmark versions based on versions defined in centmin.sh. Useful for Centmin Mod version updates as defined in FAQ #4 at http://centminmod.com/faq.html.
- Added routine to inc/openssl_install.inc to allow for OpenSSL source code patching for Nginx OpenSSL recompiles. Includes OpenSSL 1.0.1g CVE-2010-5298 Release Buffer patch.
- Added Axivo YUM repository https://www.axivo.com/resources/repository-setup.1/ for access to packages such as mydumper, elasticsearch etc
- Removed the memcache admin stats page user/password prompt and initial MariaDB MySQL root user setting/security prompts in favour of auto generating the user/passwords which will be shown at end of initial install i.e. http://centminmod.com/screenshots/centminmod/v123_07/centminmod07_new_memcacheadmin_mysqlsecurity_setup_fullunattended.png.
- Added ZOPCACHEDFT='n' variable to centmin.sh. This variable if enabled ZOPCACHEDFT='y' can override the defaults and install Zend OpCache by default instead of APC Cache defaults.
- Added new POSTFIX_INSTALL=y variable to centmin.sh change from sendmail to postfix as default
- Revised menu options - changing menu options #11 and #12. Number #11 is now a MariaDB 5.2, 5.5 and 10 upgrade sub menu option. #12 is now a dedicated menu option to install and reinstall Zend OpCache PHP opcode caching for PHP versions <5.5. For PHP 5.5 + Zend OpCache you only need to run menu #5 to specify PHP version 5.5.xx to be prompted for native Zend OpCache in PHP 5.5
- Updated OPENSSL_VER to 1.0.1h http://www.openssl.org/news/
- Updated PHP default version out of the box from 5.3.28 to 5.4.29 and included additional PHP extensions  (--with-snmp --with-gmp --with-pspell --with-tidy --with-enchant)
- Moved all downloads links themselves out of the download functions at inc/downloads.inc to their own file at inc/downloadlinks.inc for easier management
- Changed PHP's default config scan directory variable path (CONFIGSCANDIR) from /root/centminmod/php.d to /etc/centmimod/php.d. centmin.sh will auto detect this and create the necessary directory and copy over any existing PHP extension .ini files from the old path. This is preparation for when chrooted user SSH/SFTP/SCP user account support comes https://blog.centminmod.com/194 to allow chrooted users PHP binary access to PHP extensions.
- Updated PHP upgrade routine to auto reinstall previously installed PHP extensions such as APC Cache, Xcache, Memcache/Memcached, igbinary and ImagemagicK. No longer will users need to manually reinstall these PHP extensions after each PHP upgrade.  The script will detect what .ini files are in /root/centminmod/php.d (.07 release will be /etc/centminmod/php.d) when PHP upgrade is ran. Then at end of PHP upgrade will auto reinstall each PHP extension that was detected before PHP upgrade completed.
- Updated PHP configuration to autodetect if openldap-clients package is installed and if installed auto add --with-ldap --with-ldap-sasl configuration options to PHP configuration for PHP LDAP extension support http://www.php.net/manual/en/ldap.installation.php. If you don't currently have PHP LDAP extension support, just run yum -y install openldap-clients and then run centmin.sh menu option #5 to recompile PHP.
- Updated PCRE version compiled for Nginx 8.33 to 8.35 http://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt
- Updated PHP memcached extension from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0 http://pecl.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=memcached

- Updated Nginx from v1.5.8 to v1.7.2 release http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES
- Added some TCP tuned options for non-OpenVZ based servers with increased open file descriptor limits from 65536 to 262144.
- Updated Nginx WebDav module from 0.0.2 to 0.0.3 https://github.com/arut/nginx-dav-ext-module
- Updated multi-threaded compression menu with updated versions for pbzip2, lbzip2, plzip, lzip
- Updated libmemcached from 1.0.16 to 1.0.18 https://launchpad.net/libmemcached/+download
- Updated Memcached server from 1.4.17 to 1.4.20 https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/ReleaseNotes1420 and added --enable-sasl --enable-sasl-pwdb support https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/SASLAuthProtocol and https://blog.couchbase.com/sasl-memcached-now-available.
- Updated Memcache PHP extension to 3.0.8 http://pecl.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=memcache
- Updated Siege v3.0.5 to v3.0.6 http://www.joedog.org/pub/siege/ChangeLog
- Updated memcache admin php file and randomised the file name unique to each install - same as APC Cache admin page. So changed location from /usr/local/nginx/html/memcache.php to /usr/local/nginx/html/memcache_${N}.php where ${N} is randomised.
- Updated centmin.sh with 4 options PHP_DISABLED=n, MYSQLSERVICE_DISABLED=n, NSD_DISABLED=n and MEMCACHED_DISABLED=n. By default they are set to NO, so that PHP-FPM, MariaDB MySQL, NSD and Memcached server are installed and enabled (running). Some users have no use for NSD for DNS hosted locally on server and/or have no use for Memcached server or want to have an Nginx only server without running PHP-FPM and MySQL services, so you can set PHP_DISABLED=y, MYSQLSERVICE_DISABLED=y, NSD_DISABLED=y and/or MEMCACHED_DISABLED=y in centmin.sh prior to initial Centmin Mod install, so that PHP-FPM, MariaDB MySQL, NSD and Memcached are disabled but installed. This allows for you to re-enable them if needed in future. To re-enable NSD via commands service nsd start and chkconfig nsd on and for Memcached via service memcached start and chkconfig memcached on.
- Updated ngx_pagespeed module version number in centmin.sh from 1.7.30.1 beta to 1.8.31.4 beta. Only version number changed as Centmin Mod is still currently using the work around using Github master branch to work around a bug with ngx_pagespeed_message log https://groups.google.com/d/topic/ngx-pagespeed-discuss/Yb0mt3ApciU/discussion. Change log https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/release_notes
- Added inc/entropy.inc functions to increase default Entropy pool availability on non-OpenVZ systems i.e. KVM, Xen, dedicated using haveged entropy daemon http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/. More info at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-setup-additional-entropy-for-cloud-servers-using-haveged
- Added standalone Python 2.7 install Addon at /addons/python27_install.sh to install Python 2.7 along side default Python 2.6 default CentOS versions
- Added to Nginx configuration http_image_filter_module module (--with-http_image_filter_module http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_image_filter_module.html)
- Added to Nginx configuration headers-more module (http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpHeadersMoreModule and https://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module)
- Added support for Phusion Passenger https://github.com/phusion/passenger for Nginx support for Ruby, Rails and RubyGem and Python to centmin.sh and nginx_upgrade.inc. In centmin.sh default is disabled NGINX_PASSENGER='n', to enable, you need to set to NGINX_PASSENGER='y' and before reinstalling Nginx, you need to run Addon script at /addons/passenger.sh to install Ruby, RubyGems, RubyRails and Nginx Passenger depedencies and then run menu option #4 to reinstall Nginx server.
- Added support for Nginx GEOIP module by updating centmin.sh with NGINX_GEOIP=n option for Nginx GeoIP module support http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGeoipModule. NGINX_GEOIP=y will only enable and work if GeoIP database and library have been installed. You can find in Centmin Mod Addons directory a shell script at  /addons/geoip.sh which will install the GeoIP database and library. After installed, then set NGINX_GEOIP=y in centmin.sh and run menu option #4 to recompile Nginx with --with-http_geoip_module support. If you do not install GeoIP database and library before recompiling Nginx with GeoIP module, you will get the following error when restarting Nginx server. 

nginx: [emerg] unknown directive "geoip_country" in /usr/local/nginx/conf/geoip.conf:2
nginx: configuration file /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf test failed

v1.2.3-eva2000.06 26/12/2013
- Added Oracle Linux 6.x support https://blogs.oracle.com/wim/entry/oracle_linux_6_5. Centmin Mod users will now have option to install Centmin Mod on Oracle Linux 6.x series allowing Centmin Mod users to take advantage of more recent Linux kernels e.g. Oracle Linux 6.5 and 2.6.39 and 3.8.13 UEK - Unbreakable Enterprise Kernels.

To install new YUM repository for existing installs, you will need to either run menu option to recompile/upgrade Nginx or PHP and when prompted to run YUM check first, answer YES. This ensures YUM changes are synced with any new Centmin Mod version's YUM changes. Initial ground work for Centmin Mod support for Percona YUM packages. Note: MariaDB will always be default MySQL server version though. So to specifically install a Percona package you need to enable repo first i.e.

yum -q list percona-xtrabackup                     
Error: No matching Packages to list

yum -q list --enablerepo=percona percona-xtrabackup

This will make Varnish Cache available to folks who know how to install and configure Varnish for their specific web app.  To install new YUM repository for existing installs, you will need to either run menu option to recompile/upgrade Nginx or PHP and when prompted to run YUM check first, answer YES. This ensures YUM changes are synced with any new Centmin Mod version's YUM changes. For example:

yum -q list varnish
Error: No matching Packages to list

yum -q list varnish --disableexcludes=epel --disableplugin=priorities
Available Packages
varnish.x86_64	2.1.5-1.el6	epel

yum -q list varnish --disableexcludes=epel --enablerepo=varnish-3.0
Available Packages
varnish.x86_64	3.0.4-1.el6	varnish-3.0

yum -q list varnish --enablerepo=varnish-3.0
varnish.x86_64	3.0.4-1.el6	varnish-3.0

You can use --enablerepo=CentALT and --disablerepo= to select more updated package versions i.e. redis 2.4.10 in epel vs redis 2.6.7 in centalt i.e. epel repo has priority=3, so to select redis 2.6.7, yum install gperftools-devel; yum install redis --disablerepo=epel
- Add optional libatomic support to Nginx via centmin.sh set option NGINX_LIBATOMIC=y. Setting it to NGINX_LIBATOMIC=n disables libatomic support when you install or re-install, upgrade or download Nginx via centmin.sh menu option #4.
- Add option PCRE-JIT support for Nginx via centmin.sh set options NGINX_PCREJIT=y and NGINX_PCREVER='8.32. Setting NGINX_PCREJIT=n will disable PCRE-JIT support for Nginx when you install or re-install, upgrade or download Nginx via centmin.sh menu option #4.
- Add optional --with-http_dav_module http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpDavModule and nginx-dav-ext-module-XXX module https://github.com/arut/nginx-dav-ext-module support to Nginx. Controlled by centmin.sh set options for NGINX_WEBDAV=y and NGINX_EXTWEBDAVVER='0.0.2'. Setting NGINX_WEBDAV=y enables Nginx to be installed with WebDAV support. Setting NGINX_WEBDAV=n disables WebDAV support when you install or re-install, upgrade or download Nginx via centmin.sh menu option #4.
- Add nginx-http-concat module to Nginx https://github.com/taobao/nginx-http-concat
- Add libmemcached http://libmemcached.org/Release_Information.html

- Add memcached PHP extension http://pecl.php.net/package/memcached
- Add twemperf - twitter memcached benchmarking tool https://github.com/twitter/twemperf
- Add ccache http://ccache.samba.org/ - compiler caching support to speed up source recompiles by as much as 60%  for recompiling Nginx or PHP i.e. when upgrading or downgrading a previously installed Nginx (from 170 seconds reduced to 67 seconds) or PHP version (from 350 seconds reduced to 158 seconds). By default cache directory is located at /home/.ccache and with a 2 Gigabyte disk cache size set. Automated logging of Centmin Mod menu options http://centminmod.com/faq.html#loginstall now also includes ccache stats output for each menu option run as well as run time stats outlining how many seconds the option took to complete. For example, if you run menu option to upgrade PHP, the automated log saved at /root/centminlogs/ will include how many seconds it took to run PHP upgrade and the ccache statistics.
- Add /etc/centminmod-release & /etc/centminmod-versionlog files. From v1.2.3-eva2000.01 onwards, each install and upgrade will have it's version numbers written to these files so as to be able to keep track of installed versions. This will make future major feature additions easier to handle for compatibility with older Centmin Mod versions. For example, when MariaDB 5.5 support is added.
- Faster Centmin Mod installation - up to 40% faster than v1.2.2. Migrating code almost to fully unattented install mode. 
- Rewritten source download file functions. Moving majority of the download process to the top of the script before actual Centmin Mod Install routine. This allows for broken download links to be detected and compressed tarball downloads to be validated before installation proceeds. Failed downloads or invalid compressed tarball downloads (incomplete downloads) will abort the the script allowing you to correct the download links before re-running install. When failed download or invalid compressed tarball package errors occur, you can check Centmin Mod log for specific details at /root/centminlogs/. Download routines have been moved to inc/downloads.inc file.

Changes aren't updated automatically, you will need to update the /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf manually to remove line log_format bytes_log "$msec $bytes_sent ."; and add the line access_log logs/access.log combined buffer=32k;. You can compare using download zip's copy at config/nginx/nginx.conf to compare against your live servers copy

When run menu option, the entire process will be logged to a time stamped text log file named ${CENTMINLOGDIR}/centminmod_${SCRIPT_VERSION}_${DT}_*.log so you can review the logs for error messages etc.
